# Quantum Experiments

![Quantum computing](quantum_computing.jpg)

I want to contribute something back to society. Researching potentially breakthrough technologies, such as quantum computing, allows me to find how to practically make an impact.

## Installation

1. Create an [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) account.
1. Install Qiskit by following one of the [text](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html) or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4EkW4VwhcI&list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY&index=3&t=0s) tutorials.
1. Clone the repository using one of the following methods.
    - SSH: `git clone git@github.com:neelkamath/quantum-experiments.git`
    - HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/neelkamath/quantum-experiments.git`

## Usage

Standalone programs are in their own directories in `src/`.

Use the [circuit composer](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer) to run OpenQASM programs, and Jupter notebooks for the Qiskit ones.

## Contributing

Create a directory (e.g., `Half adder`) in `src/`. In this directory, save the program files (e.g., `program.qasm`, `notebook.ipynb`). If the program uses OpenQASM, save an image of the circuit (e.g., `circuit.png`) too.
